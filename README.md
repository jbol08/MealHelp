# MealHelp

Link to site: https://mealhelp.herokuapp.com/

### Description
This is a site I designed to help my wife be able to find recipes easier because she has dietary intolerances and sifting through google was quite a task. This allows a user
to look up recipes, and to create an account so that they can saved recipes to their favorites.

Recipes can be filtered by intolerances and a user can even just select an intolerance without including any ingredients and they will get a list of random meals that fit that
intolerance. 

User passwords are hased and stored through encryption.
